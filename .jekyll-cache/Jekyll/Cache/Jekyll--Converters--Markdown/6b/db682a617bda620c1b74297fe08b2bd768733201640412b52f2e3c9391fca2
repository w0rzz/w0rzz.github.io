<p>Virtual Reality(VR) is a technology that puts a user in a distant or virtual environment and allows the user to experience a space which cannot be reached physically. It offers a sense of depth and presence which you cannot get even with the best quality HD TV screens. This is achieved by the use of VR headsets. It gives an illusion of presence to wearer of the headset.</p>

<p>Virtual Reality has been used for medical, flight simulation, automobile industry design, and military training purposes for a very long time now. A few gaming companies like atari and sega also tried to venture into VR but they weren’t widely accepted at that time. It wasn’t used for entertainment until around last decade with the invention of the Occulus Rift by Palmer Luckey in 2010.</p>

<p>With all the fuss been said and seen about VR, one might think that the technology behind this “telepresence” of a thing is so ambigious, meanwhile</p>
