<p>Virtual Reality(VR) is a technology that puts a user in a distant or virtual environment and allows user to experience a space which cannot be reached. It offers a sense of depth and presence which you cannot achieve with even the highest quality HD TV screens. This is achieved by the use of VR headsets. It gives an illusion of presence to wearer of the headset.</p>
