<p>Virtual Reality(VR) is a technology that puts a user in a distant or virtual environment and allows the user to experience a space which cannot be reached physically. It offers a sense of depth and presence which you cannot get even with the best quality HD TV screens. This is achieved by the use of VR headsets. 
<!-- It gives an illusion of presence to wearer of the headset. --></p>

<p>Virtual Reality has been used for medical, flight simulation, automobile industry design, and military training purposes for a very long time now. A few gaming companies like atari and sega also tried to venture into VR but they weren’t widely accepted at that time. It wasn’t used for entertainment until around last decade with the invention of the Occulus Rift by Palmer Luckey in 2010.</p>

<p>Since then, VR has become really popular and today there are so many VR headsets in the market. With so many games available across various platforms. Playing a VR game is jusst as good as entering the TV screen and playing the role of the character.</p>

<p>With all the fuss being said and seen about VR, one might think that the technology behind this “telepresence” of a thing is so ambigious. Meanwhile, the working principle of a VR headset is very simple. Its just a pair of convex lens each to magnify a screen in front of it to give an illusion of presence to the wearer of the headset. They have IMUs(motion sensors) so that as you nod or rotate your head, the camera in the virtual scene follows suit. That is all there is to that “obscure gizmo” that WoWs you whenever you put it on.</p>

<p>Basically, there are three different kinds of VR headsets:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Smartphone-based</li>
  <li>PC/Console-based</li>
  <li>Standalone</li>
</ol>

<p>There’s really nothing to <strong>Smartphone-based</strong> VR headsets, its just a pair of lenses. Your smartphone will act as a screen and motion sensor with the help of the motion sensors that are present in your device. Unfortunately though, motion sensors are not complete in all smartphones, they all have accelerometers, which measures the devices tilting angle. Gyroscopes are also needed to determine the rotational angle of the device for a complete VR experience, but not all smartphones have gyroscopes. Hence, smartphones without gyroscopes are not VR compatible and will not not play most VR games, won’t even be able to install some. To know if your android device is VR compatible, there are several apps that will tell you your fate at the click of a button by simply detecting the presence or absence of a gyroscope in your device. We started to see smartphone-based VR headsets in 2014 with the introduction of the cardboard by google. Google cardboards come in form of pieces of cartons with a pair of lenses you arrange and place your phone for viewing stuff. Since then a lot of companies have produced similar and even better-looking headsets adding more juice to it like strap-ons, cushions, headphones, controllers etc. If you’re going to be seeing a movie with your cardboard or headset, you gotta download a VR player kinda app which splits the view-screen into two equal halves, one for each lens.</p>

<p>Two smartphone-based VR headsets that are worth talking about are Samsung gear VR and Google Daydream View.
The samsung gear VR works with a samsung galaxy device which acts as a display and processor while the headset itself acts as an IMU for rotational tracking, connecting to the smartphone via USB-C or micro-USB. The Gear VR headset also includes a touchpad and back button on the side, as well as a proximity sensor to detect when the headset is on.
Google Daydream was a platform</p>
